# üìã Task Management Application

A simple and clean task management application built with React. This project allows users to add, view, and manage their daily tasks. It was created as part of the "React Week 7, Day 1" learning module to demonstrate fundamental React concepts.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **Add New Tasks:** Easily add new tasks to your to-do list.
*   **View All Tasks:** See a clear list of all your current tasks.
*   **Delete Tasks:** Remove tasks once they are completed or no longer needed.
*   **Persistent State (via API):** Uses `axios` to prepare for communication with a backend API for fetching and saving tasks.
*   **Unique ID Generation:** Employs `uuid` to ensure every task has a unique identifier.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

*   **Frontend:** [React](https://reactjs.org/) (v19)
*   **Bootstrapped with:** [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
*   **HTTP Client:** [Axios](https://axios-http.com/)
*   **Unique IDs:** [UUID](https://github.com/uuidjs/uuid)
*   **Testing:** [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) & [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm) installed on your computer.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Kumarswamy-palakuri/react-week-7-day-1.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```
    cd react-week-7-day-1
    ```

3.  **Install the dependencies:**
    ```
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Run the application:**
    ```
    npm start
    ```

The application will open in your default browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## üìú Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**
This command will remove the single build dependency from your project and copy all configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project.





# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
